# Advanced-Encryption-Tool

This tool is coded using only Python. It uses the PyCryptoDome library to encrypt files. The tool creates a unique salt for each file and assigns it to the file to derive the key using the PBKDF2(much more secure for brute-force and dictionary attacks) hash function. The tool also encrypts the file name and renames the current file with random numbers, Also I used CustomTkinter to create the best user-experience to encrypt files

## Installation

EXE. Files and open-source code will be released soon

```bash
